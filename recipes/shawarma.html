        <h3>What is Chicken Shawarma, actually??</h3>
        <p>Shawarma is a popular dish originating from the Middle East.  it's a popular street food that is traditionally made in the form of spiced meats that are stacked on a vertical rotisserie with thin slices shaved off as it rotates. But don't worry! We can cook our horizontally in a good old pan or on the BBQ!</p>
        <p>Shawarma was traditionally made with lamb,mutton and chicken though these days you see it with beef too. It's commonly served in the form of a wrap, though in some countries you see it served on plates with sides such as seasoned rice or fries and salads. In this recipe, I'm giving you both options!</p>
